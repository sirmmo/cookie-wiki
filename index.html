      <p>With <a href="http://cookie.tools">cookie.tools</a> we ranted about the law. With Cookie Wiki we want to address the structure of cookies themselves, helping developers help the end-users to understand what is within their cooies</p>
      <p>Every kind of cookie is in a json file in the "/cookies" url - i.e. <a target="_blank" href="/cookies/__utma.json">http://cookie.wiki/cookies/__utma.json</a>, for devs to use. You can even get a small description page by going to <a href="/show/">cookie show</a>.</p>
